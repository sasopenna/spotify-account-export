# Spotify Account Export

This is a simply tool developed in JavaScript which is able to export *Music Library, Albums, Followed Artists and Playlists* from an account to another.

You **must** know each one of the *OAuth Tokens* of the accounts to be able to use the tool, or a JSON file previously exported.

You can choose which item to export and which not. You can also *stop* the process if you want.

(Note: If the process gets stopped, the data that was already imported **will not get removed**)


# How to use

Connect to the [**Spotify Account Export**](http://sasopenna.github.io/spotify/) page.

Choose your exporting method, which can be *OAuth* or *JSON*. 

Everything is now explained onscreen.
