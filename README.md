# Spotify Account Export

This is a simply tool developed in JavaScript which is able to export *Music Library, Albums, Followed Artists and Playlists* from an account to another.

You **must** know each one of the *OAuth Tokens* of the accounts to be able to use the tool.

You can choose which item to export and which not. You can also *stop* the process if you want.

(Note: If the process gets stopped, the data that was already imported **will not get removed**)
